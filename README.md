# Microservice-artitucture_learning

The mini project for learning microservice architecture involves building a simple application using microservices. It focuses on breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other. Through this project, participants gain hands-on experience
in designing, implementing, and deploying microservices, enabling them to understand the key principles and benefits of this architectural approach.
